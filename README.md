# Electron App/React App Scaffold

This is boilerplate for a react app that can also be used as an electron application. I am particularaly pleased with the way I implemented hot reload functionality, as I am a champion for the developer experience (DX).

I wanted this to be a container of best practices, but without much content it was kind of difficult to implement client and server side rendering because I hardly have any content to chunk/lazy load.

I will continue to add different features to it as an exercise, but it is pretty bare.

However, once I do have something to build this will be a good starting point.
