# Electron App with MUI v5 Library and Hot Reload

PURPOSE
A skeleton for electron apps using a react frontend. Includes built-in functionality for a prime developer experience (DX).

- hot reload without ejecting
- single start command for both React and electron (--> 'yarn knit')
- switch branches while developing and hot reload automatically detects change

APPEARANCE
Implement your own theming; might I recommend the ever popular MUI v5 or tailwindCSS? Tachyons are great for quick shorthand, but less intuitive to other devs (any maybe yourself after some time). Sass is added by default.

-----Branches
Routes:

- enables routing

Authentication:

- shows login/authentication before giving access to other routes
